WMDD 4820 FINAL PROJECT - flashcard app

Melissa Chiam


This is a flashcard app that can save questions in a list and shuffles the questions in the list when displaying the questions.

Things it can do: save question-hint pairs to a list, save the list to localstorage, load the list from localstorage, delete list items, delete all items, and do minor manipulation to the DOM to display the questions one by one as a flashcard.
